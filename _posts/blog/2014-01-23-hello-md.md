## New Journey ##
It's already the 23rd day in 2015, the first month of the 15th year in twenty first century almost done, but I can't believe that the time flying so fast that sometimes I still sign 2014 sometimes. Look back toward the last year, I still feel unbelievable even now. 

Back to 2013, I decided to move to US after a considerable evaluation and discussion with my family. And here is the time line for the whole process:

* 2011/10 The first time to US for a business travel
* 2013/4  Decide to move to US
* 2013/7  GRE exam
* 2013/8  TOEFL exam
* 2013/9  Start to apply US graduate programs
* 2013/10 Start to receive the offer from US universities
* 2013/11 Accept Stevens's offer
* 2013/11 Apply F1 Visa
* 2013/12 Book flight ticket to New York
* 2014/1  Departure to Stevens for a new journey
* 2014/12 Graduation from Stevens after three semesters' study(Spring, Summer and Fall).
* 2014/12 Head to Bay area to join Intel

What an amazing journey start! I really fell lucky and appreciate all the support from my family and friends, especially the encourage and help during my preparation in 2013, which is a long and tough way but make you encouraging! Too many of them, I would keep all of them in mind rather than list here.


## Why this?##
For a long time, I wish I could find some place that I can place my thinking there, no matter it's technique related or any ideas burst in, the last, also the most important, will construct


## The goal ##
It's already the 23rd day in 2015, can't believe that the time flying so fast that I sign 2014 sometimes yet. Look back award to the last year, I still feel unbelievable even now.
